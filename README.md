### Hash map (object dictionary)
In JavaScript, a hash map (also known as an object or dictionary) is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values based on keys. It uses a hash function to map keys to specific locations (buckets) within the data structure, making it efficient to insert, delete, and retrieve values. Hash maps are often used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the map.

Here's a basic example of a hash map in JavaScript:


```javascript
const hashMap = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2',
  key3: 'value3'
};
```
You can access values in a hash map using their keys like this:

```javascript
console.log(hashMap.key1); // Output: 'value1'
```
Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Here's a solution to this problem using a hash map:

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  const charMap = {}; // Hash map to store characters and their indices
  let maxLength = 0;
  let start = 0; // Start of the current substring

  for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
    const char = s[end];

    if (charMap[char] !== undefined && charMap[char] >= start) {
      // If the character is already in the substring, update the starting position
      start = charMap[char] + 1;
    }

    // Store the index of the current character in the hash map
    charMap[char] = end;

    // Calculate the length of the current substring
    const currentLength = end - start + 1;

    // Update maxLength if the current substring is longer
    if (currentLength > maxLength) {
      maxLength = currentLength;
    }
  }

  return maxLength;
}

// Example usage
const input = "abcabcbb";
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring(input)); // Output: 3 (The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc.")
```

Explanation:

- We use a charMap hash map to store characters from the string s as keys and their indices as values.
- We initialize start to 0, which represents the start of the current substring without repeating characters.
- We iterate through the string s using a sliding window approach, represented by the start and end pointers.
- When we encounter a character that is already in the substring, we update the start pointer to the next position after the last occurrence of that character.
- We update the charMap with the current character's index.
- We calculate the length of the current substring and update maxLength if the current length is greater than the previous maximum length.
- Finally, we return maxLength, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 In the example usage, the input string "abcabcbb" has the longest substring without repeating characters as "abc," which has a length of 3, so the function returns 3.

Notice
Try to do the "TwoSum" problem as well.
